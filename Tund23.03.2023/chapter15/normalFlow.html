    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <p>
        In 1817 baron von Drais invented a walking machine border-top-right-radius
        would help him get around the royal gardens faster.Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy 
        text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
         standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
          type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
           but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

        the machine became known as the draisienne (or "hobby horse").
        It was made entirely of wood. this enjoyed a short lived
        popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in 
        any other place than a well mantained pathway such as in 
        park or garden

        The next appearance of a two-wheeld riding machine was in
        1865, then pedals where applied directly to the front wheel.
        this ,achine was know as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot")
        as well as the "bone shaker", since it is wooden structure.
